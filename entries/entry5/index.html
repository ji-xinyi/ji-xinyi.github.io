                <h3>Diego</h3>
    
                <img src="./media/imgs/diego.JPG" alt="a little baby german shepard"> 
                <p>Saw him at the dog park across the street from where I live with a friend. He was positively obessed with a squeaky tennis ball he had in his mouth. <br>
                Diego is almost 9 months old!</p>
    
            <h5>“All he wants to do right now is play with the ball”</h5>

            <img src="./media/imgs/russet.JPG" alt="a beautiful girl"> 
    
            <p>Met Russet with her babysitter outside a french restaurant in Soho.</p>
    
            <h5>“Aw she LOVES saying hi!”</h5>
    
             <p>She was very eager to take pictures and be pet!</p>

                <h3>Zed!</h3>

                <h4>Zed!</h4>
    
                <p>Zed was adopted from South Korea and is a Jindo mix! She comes up to about my calf height and she wags her tail like a helicopter.</p>
    
            <h5>“She's so in love with you” </h5>

            <img src="./media/imgs/momo.JPG" class="img-top" alt="Adorable babies"> 
    
            <p>Met this pair of corgis being walked on my way back after getting a white chocolate matcha latte. Truffles is 2 and Momo is 1, and they were both especially excited to be pet and adored.</p>
    
            <h5>“Hey no licking! Chocolate isn't good for you!”</h5>
