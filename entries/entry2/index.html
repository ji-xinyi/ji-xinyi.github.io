        <h2 class="left heading">Bruno & Izzy</h2>
            <h3 class="left subhead"> 13th st & 4th ave</h3>

            <p class="right body">Was on the way to the UC with a friend when Bruno came running over to us! a 4 month-old boy who can’t wait to mingle and have so much fun. <br>
            Eagerly ran in circles and up and down, in and out of my lap with Izzy!</p>

        <h5 class="right quote">“... he just wants to play... he’s gonna get bigger too, he’s just 4 months  old,”... <br>“aww stop, he’s going to be such a big boy!”</h5>

             <p class="right body">Izzy couldn’t wait to meet Bruno, was just as eager to play and receive pets from my friend and I. 8 months and enough energy to power two apartment buildings in the city.</p>

        <p class="left body">Freddie came by my building for a visit and we collectively spent a good half hour catching up and passing him around like we were playing pass-the-parcel.</p>

        <h5 class="left quote">“he’s so tiny!”,<br>
            “freDDIEEeee!” <br>
            “is he going to get any bigger?”</h5>

         <p class="right body">He was so sleepy, but don’t let that fool you. We were told that he bullies his older sister, Honey Dew by stealing her food and locking her in her crate when they’re alone. Tsk tsk....</p>

            <h4 class="left caption">Blue!</h4>

            <p class="right body">Blue is an eager and excited puppy who loves pets. I was sitting outside the dog run at Madison Square Park. He was just excited to be there with so many other dogs and people who were willing to risk everything for him.</p>

        <h5 class="right quote">“he’s so cute!” <br>
            “I know! He bites though so sorry about that- no blue, no biting!” </h5>
